I have a bunch of quite old MIDI compositions lying around, but stored in a prorietary format by Cakewalk. I also want to listen to the files. As I don't want to run that program anymore, here's an attempt to reverse engineer the format in order to convert to a known format (.mid?). Hi tech!

Most of my files are Cakewalk format version 3, so that's what this project will support.
